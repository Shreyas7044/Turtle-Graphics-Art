# 🎨 Creating Graphics with Python Turtle

This project demonstrates how to create beautiful graphical patterns using Python's Turtle Graphics module. Turtle is a simple drawing library that helps beginners understand programming concepts visually.

## 📌 What is Turtle Graphics?

Turtle graphics uses a virtual "turtle" that moves around the screen drawing lines as it goes.

- `forward()` moves the turtle
- `left()` or `right()` rotates it
- Color and width create artistic effects

---

## 🧠 How This Program Works

1. A turtle object is created.
2. The background color is set to black.
3. A list of colors is used to cycle pen colors.
4. A loop runs 360 times:
   - Changes color dynamically
   - Increases pen width gradually
   - Moves forward increasing distance
   - Rotates left by 59 degrees

This combination produces a spiral geometric art pattern.
